# RescuEye: Thermal-Based Victim Detection System

## Overview
RescuEye is an innovative disaster response system that leverages thermal imaging and machine learning to detect and classify victims in disaster areas. Traditional ML models often struggle with victim detection due to similar background-foreground colors (e.g., victims covered in debris). RescuEye overcomes this limitation by detecting victims based on body temperature through thermal imaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit**: For interactive web application interface
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing and manipulation
- **Roboflow**: For ML model deployment and predictions
- **Supervision**: For annotation and visualization
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image handling
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization and plotting

## Features and Results

### 1. Victim Detection
The system accurately detects victims using thermal signatures, even in conditions where traditional visual detection fails.

| *Original thermal image showing disaster scene* | *Detected victims* | *Heatmap of the detected victims* |

### 2. Resource Allocation
Based on the number of detected victims, the system calculates necessary relief materials.

| Input Dashboard | Output Calculation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| *Count of the no of detected victims* | ![Resource allocation-NonFoodReliefItems](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ffc6e27-0446-4a1f-8b39-72e587bdfe66)| ![FoodRelief Items](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5b3b8e-953f-4fc9-b098-2028577f72a6) |
| *Input*| *Resource Allocation(Non-Food Relief Items)* | *Resource Allocation(Food Relief Items)* |

### 3. Injury Classification
Classifies victims based on their thermal signatures to prioritize medical attention.

| Input Thermal Image | Output Classification |
